ASP.NETCSharpMVC-OptionSelection
================================

Assignment: Create a web application that allows users (ie. students) to submit their selection of options (ie. specializations), as well as allow an administrator to view all submissions and manage options, users, and roles.

Action: Worked in a team of 2 to design and implement the application using ASP.NET C# MVC. We used code first development to create the database. We used a RESTful web API and Ajax functions for generating and submitting the form. The application is responsive, using Twitter Bootstrap. This project may be viewed at http://www.a3.chanying.ca. To login as the administrator, the username is admin1 and the password is P@$$w0rd.  

Result: Received full marks on the assignment.
